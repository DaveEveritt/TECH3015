|:-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------:|
| This coursework is:                      | **Individual / ~~Group~~**              | 
| Date set:                                | **6th January 2020**                    |

| Your marked coursework and feedback due: | **Thursday 7th May 2020**               |

If for any reason this is not forthcoming by the due date your module leader will let you know why and when it can be expected. The Associate Professor Student Experience (<a href='mailto:CEMstudentexperience@dmu.ac.uk'>CEMstudentexperience@dmu.ac.uk</a>) should be informed of any issues relating to the return of marked coursework and feedback.

Note that you should normally receive feedback on your coursework by no later than 20 University working days after the formal hand-in date, provided that you have met the submission deadline.

### Submitting your coursework

**When completed, you are required to submit your coursework as follows:**

- Your **report** as a PDF, through the Turnitin link in the Assessments section of the TECH3015 Blackboard pag ([see deliverables below](#deliverables))
- Your **website** should be in your **public_html**, in a folder named */TECH3015/coursework2/*—name the landing page 'home.html' (the usual 'index.html' makes it impossible for tutors to view the code and other files)

**Late submission of coursework policy**  
Late submissions will be processed in accordance with current University regulations which state:

> “the time period during which a student may submit a piece of work late without authorisation and have the work capped at 40% [50% at PG level] if passed is 14 calendar days. Work submitted unauthorised more than 14 calendar days after the original submission date will receive a mark of 0%. These regulations apply to a student’s first attempt at coursework. Work submitted late without authorisation which constitutes reassessment of a previously failed piece of coursework will always receive a mark of 0%.”

**Academic Offences and Bad Academic Practices**  
These include plagiarism, cheating, collusion, copying work and reuse of your own work, poor referencing or the passing off of somebody else's ideas as your own. If you are in any doubt about what constitutes an academic offence or bad academic practice you must check with your tutor. Further information and details of how DSU can support you, if needed, is available from the Academic Support Office at these links:

- [Academic Offences](http://www.dmu.ac.uk/dmu-students/the-student-gateway/academic-support-office/academic-offences.aspx)
- [Bad Academic Practice](http://www.dmu.ac.uk/dmu-students/the-student-gateway/academic-support-office/bad-academic-practice.aspx)

## Overview

The website and report together are worth **60%** of the overall module total. For the second coursework you will produce an individual website or web-based work.

You are encouraged to seek feedback about your ongoing work from your lab tutor throughout the second semester.

---

## Website (60% of CW 2)

In semester 1 you designed and prototyped a modern web app or website. For this coursework you will create a responsive website—based on your work so far—using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

First, decide on modifications to the design as a result of feedback from your ‘testers’ and tutor. You can then focus on developing your web coding skills to make your planned design come to life.

If you decide to change your design or topic, explain why and how in the report.

## Report (40% of CW 2)

The report must document your updated design (if modified), explain your media preparation and knowledge of code, and make a critical evaluation of your finished project—what worked, what could be improved, explanations of decisions you made along the way, and how you might want to take the work further in future.

Make notes during the process of creating your website, so you can simply edit these before you submit the report rather than trying to remember your process retrospectively.

If you don't want to use your design or topic from Coursework 1, explain how and why you have readjusted your plans.

---

## Key points to consider:

- Examine the [marking criteria](#marking-criteria) closely. A good mark for Coursework 1 doesn't automatically translate to a website that meets the criteria for coursework 2 - you may need to adapt your design or prototype
- Don't skimp on **user testing** - this is critically important and **will** get you a better mark
- [validate your HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) (this is crucial) and at least run your [CSS through a validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), and [check for accessibility issues](https://wave.webaim.org/) (although these can be advisory) and briefly document this process
- **Reference any content** that’s not yours (images, music, sounds, online tutorial code not included in the learning materials etc.) e.g. in a list or appendix in the documentation (note: Google or other search engines themselves are *not* primary sources of information). Failure to do so is plagiarism and may effect your grade.
- **prepare your media**: content such as audio interviews, videos, images will be marked primarily on its suitability for web deployment rather than its own production value. Prepare media for quick download on the web, and demonstrate your knowledge of this requirement. Other modules are keenly assessed on the production value of your digital output, so you can speak to your relevant tutor about this.

## Where to Start?

- think about how your designs will translate into code, especially the main blocks of content
- [validate your HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) at each major stage and fix any errors early—don't allow any broken code!
- start a document to make notes about your process and decisions
- get a basic responsive and mobile-fist structure up and running that follows your design
- upload to your public_html folder as you go along and get some feedback from testers


## Deliverables

1. the website, in your public_html folder
2. your critical report, in PDF format

## Website

**Weighting:** 60% of the coursework mark, assessed on the three points outlined below, each weighted 20% of the mark for coursework 2.

Your site should be accessible via your `public_html` folder. It should be located at `public_html > TECH3015 > coursework2 > website` - use `home.html` rather than the standard `index.html` so we can see the full file listing.

### Content

Your website content should be fully funcional and robust (valid HTML, no missing images, JavaScript errors, etc.). This includes all text, graphics, images and any audio/video. You should use the correct HTML5 code to display these and ensure you have prepared your media for the web.

* HTML5 markup uses semantic tags appropriately
* Text content has semantic structure e.g. headings, lists
* Careful selection, preparation and editing of video and/or audio
* Awareness of loading speed and disk space e.g. no huge images 
* Your own original content is credited and any third-party content referenced (media from a single source can have just a single general credit/reference)

### Style

Your website should appeal to your intended audience and be consistent with your mockups/designs. You should make efficient use of CSS in order to style and position elements for your site.

* Style and layout reflect/have evolved from design
* Coherent overall design, colour and font choices
* Design and content matches the target audience
* Skilful use of CSS to style and arrange site elements
* no duplicate CSS, classes instead of IDs for selectors
* well-ordered CSS: mobile-first followed by `min-width` breakpoints to be fully responsive at any screen width

### Technical Skills 

Your web site should demonstrate your ability to apply the concepts you have learnt in this module.

* Evidence of your ability to choose and code current web markup, style and programming
* Awareness of usability/accessibility (semantic HTML5 tags, image “alt” attributes, other considerations)
* Use of CSS animations and transitions (subtle or otherwise!)
* No broken links or missing media, site is consistent across mobile and larger platforms
* Use of at least two of:
	* Local database storage
	* Third-party APIs
	* animation
	* JavaScript user interaction and/or functionality

## Documentation

**Weighting:** 40% of the coursework mark, broken down as follows.  
**Word Count:** 1500-2000 words with images. References and appendices not included in word count.

Your documentation should consist of the following components:

### Overview of Designs

**Weighting:** 10% of the coursework mark 
 
Include images of your final designs, whether updated or not, accompanied by a commentary addressing:

* what was strong about your design
* what has changed and why
* what you think your main challenge(s) were
* what you consider to be the most important feature(s) of your design

This should be written in light of your own evaluation of your design from CW1, with your peer and tutor feedback.

### Production

**Weighting:** 10% of the coursework mark

Offer some insight into the development of your website. Pick three individual components and discuss:

* What you were trying to achieve
* How you did this
* Why you chose a certain approach
* How successful the outcome was

Examples of what is meant here by an individual component of your website include a slideshow, a dropdown menu, an accordian display, an animated transition between pages, etc.

### Evaluation

**Weighting:** 20% of the coursework mark  

Address the following points:

* Evidence of code testing (e.g. all links work, media loads, the site is consistent across browsers) and the HTML has been validated.
* Evidence and a breakdown of structured user testing and feedback.  
* Evaluate your work, with reference to testing where appropriate, and user feedback, describing:  
	* Your achievements, refer back to the original aims, explain any changes and why or how they were implemented.  
	* Any limitations of your web site  
	* Any improvements you would make to the site and why  
	* Any problems you encountered along the way, referencing any solutions you found or devised
