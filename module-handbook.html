<p>I hope you enjoy studying this module through your final year and find that you learn many valuable skills from it. It is a modern reality that many creative disciplines can be enhanced with at least a working knowledge of how the web works. An incredible amount of content is now delivered over the Internet, from short form videos to full blockbusters, from amateur audio clips to platinum albums, images, radio, applications and more. Whether you’re a videographer, sound engineer, animator or editor, an understanding of the web should be a key component of your skillset.</p>
<p>Throughout the module please get in touch if you have anything to say on the content or the way we teach it. We’re very open to both positive and negative feedback — it helps to shape and improve the module. Similarly, if you’re having problems keeping up or don’t understand a particular concept, please let us know as soon as possible so we can help you as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="module-description">Module Description</h2>
<p>This module will build on your work last year in TECH2015, as well as what you did in TECH1015  and develop your understanding of media presentation using the Internet. Through the course of this module you’ll develop a more nuanced approach that will consider the needs of different users consuming your media through a range of platforms.</p>
<p>You will build on your technical understanding of the languages of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through these languages you will investigate issues of layout, style, animation, and interactivity, all with a keen focus on the user and the user experience. You will also make use of existing online resources and data sources.</p>
<p>Throughout the module you are encouraged to undertake your own research into the software and practices we undertake. You should develop the ability to solve problems encountered in your work in an independent fashion, though your lab tutor will step in if necessary.</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to the Contents</a></p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>At the end of the module, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy and critically evaluate an interactive web-based project incorporating dynamic multimedia content.</li>
<li>Understand and evaluate complex issues related to browser platforms, accessibility, usability and mobile access when developing dynamic and animated content on the web.</li>
<li>Collect, evaluate, and analyse feedback from users at various points in the development cycle of a Multimedia application.</li>
<li>Develop strategies for the effective design and planning of a multimedia production.</li>
<li>Research, synthesise and adapt solutions to technical problems</li>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> learn to filter what you find and check the date as some resources (including W3Schools) contain outdated information. For HTML that could be (e.g.) <code>&lt;div class=&quot;header&quot;&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and for JavaScript, using (e.g.) <code>var</code>, when <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are current practice.</p>

<h2 id="blackboard-virtual-learning-environment">Blackboard Virtual Learning Environment</h2>
<p>This module makes use of Blackboard – De Montfort University’s Virtual Learning Environment. It is important that you access Blackboard regularly to keep up to date with:</p>
<ul>
<li>General notices and announcements</li>
<li>Lab activities and exercises</li>
<li>Lecture slides and recordings</li>
<li>Assessments</li>
<li>Your assessment feedback</li>

<h2 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h2>
<p>DMU defines plagiarism as <strong>“the deliberate attempt to gain advantage by presenting any work, data or concepts (including drafts and work in progress) that are not the student’s own as if they were”</strong>. The University takes a very serious stance against copying other people’s work without giving the proper credit.</p>
<p>You can read more about plagiarism and other acedemic offences in <a href="https://www.dmu.ac.uk/documents/dmu-students/academic-support-office/student-regulations/chapter-4-17.18.pdf">Chapter 4 of the student regulations</a>.</p>
<p>If you use somebody else’s work, either as research or directly, always attribute the author/artist/musician etc in the proper way. In this module we use the Harvard Referencing style. Directions on the use of the Harvard referencing system can be found through the <a href="http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Images/Selfstudy/Harvard.pdf">DMU library website</a></p>
<p>If you are found to of copied work without crediting the source you are likely to face a disciplinary panel and could see your mark reduced to 0, or worse in extreme cases.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding plagiarism and other academic practice offences, you can email either of the Leicester Media School's Academic Practice Officers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simon Walsh <a href="mailto:simon.walsh@dmu.ac.uk">simon.walsh@dmu.ac.uk</a></li>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>You will be assessed continuously through the module with formal feedback given at two key points through the year as well as informally in labs. The full details of coursework 1 and 2 follows this brief overview.</p>
<h3 id="coursework-1">Coursework 1</h3>
<p><strong>Date and time due: 12pm (midday) on Monday 21st December 2020</strong></p>
<p>Worth <strong>40%</strong> of the module total, your first coursework will see you produce an individual piece of work. This will involve planning and designing a responsive website, this should include wireframe sketches, final designs including navigation, mood board, content inventory, testing from card-sorting in the labs and interaction design (what changes, how and why). You also need to explain how you will prepare media types and text content for web delivery.</p>
<h3 id="coursework-2">Coursework 2</h3>
<p><strong>Date and time due: 12pm (midday) on Tuesday 4th May 2021</strong></p>
<p>Worth <strong>60%</strong> of the module total, this coursework will tackle HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ES6 to have you produce the website or web application you designed for coursework 1.</p>
<h3 id="some-notes-on-assessment-submissions">Some notes on assessment submissions</h3>
<p>All written submissions (i.e. reports and documentation) should be submitted through Turnitin. You will find a link to submit your report through the Assessment section on Blackboard.</p>
<p>You will be required to create a logical folder structure on your public server to which you will upload your practical work for marking. Follow the instructions for structure and naming exactly, and don’t put anything there that shouldn’t be marked. If your tutor is in any doubt as to where your work is, it may not get marked.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> make sure you get into the habit of using only <em>lower-case only</em> filenames with hyphens "-" or underscores "_" and (if you need) numbers, but <strong>no spaces or slashes)</strong>—this is especially important on your public server!</p>
<p>If you are unsure about any details of an assessment, ask your lab tutor.</p>
<p>To reiterate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All written work through Turnitin</strong></li>
<li><strong>All practical work uploaded to your public server space</strong></li>
</ul>
