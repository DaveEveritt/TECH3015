## DESIGN FOR THE WEB **01**

Many organisations have a **style guide document** so _all_ printed and web materials are maintained in the organisationâ€™s style

- layout
- graphics
- colours
- fonts
- logo
- photos

## DESIGN FOR THE WEB **02**

The three big software companies each have **interface guidelines**

- [Google Material Design](https://material.io/design/introduction/)
- [Apple Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/)
- [Microsoft User Interface Principles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/appuistart/-user-interface-principles)

These are long, detailed and technical in places, so scan through first
