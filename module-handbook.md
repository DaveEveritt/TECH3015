## Welcome to Multimedia III

I hope you enjoy studying this module through your final year and find that you learn many valuable skills from it. It is a modern reality that many creative disciplines can be enhanced with at least a working knowledge of how the web works. An incredible amount of content is now delivered over the Internet, from short form videos to full blockbusters, from amateur audio clips to platinum albums, images, radio, applications and more. Whether you’re a videographer, sound engineer, animator or editor, an understanding of the web should be a key component of your skillset. 

Throughout the module please get in touch if you have anything to say on the content or the way we teach it. We’re very open to both positive and negative feedback — it helps to shape and improve the module. Similarly, if you’re having problems keeping up or don’t understand a particular concept, please let us know as soon as possible so we can help you as soon as possible.

## Module Description

This module will build on your work last year in TECH2015, as well as what you did in TECH1015  and develop your understanding of media presentation using the Internet. Through the course of this module you’ll develop a more nuanced approach that will consider the needs of different users consuming your media through a range of platforms. 

You will build on your technical understanding of the languages of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through these languages you will investigate issues of layout, style, animation, and interactivity, all with a keen focus on the user and the user experience. You will also make use of existing online resources and data sources.  

Throughout the module you are encouraged to undertake your own research into the software and practices we undertake. You should develop the ability to solve problems encountered in your work in an independent fashion, though your lab tutor will step in if necessary.

<a name="plagiarism"></a>

## Plagiarism

DMU defines plagiarism as “the deliberate attempt to gain advantage by presenting any work, data or concepts (including drafts and work in progress) that are not the student’s own as if they were”. The University takes a very serious stance against copying other people’s work without giving the proper credit. 

You can read more about plagiarism and other acedemic offences in Chapter 4 of the student regulations: <https://www.dmu.ac.uk/documents/dmu-students/academic-support-office/student-regulations/chapter-4-17.18.pdf>

If you use somebody else’s work, either as research or directly, always attribute the author/artist/musician etc in the proper way. In this module we use the Harvard Referencing style. Directions on the use of the Harvard referencing system can be found through the library website: <http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Images/Selfstudy/Harvard.pdf>

If you are found to of copied work without crediting the source you are likely to face a disciplinary panel and could see your mark reduced to 0, or worse in extreme cases.

If you have any questions regarding plagiarism and other academic practice offences, you can email either of the Leicester Media School's Academic Practice Officers:  
Simon Walsh <simon.walsh@dmu.ac.uk>  
Helen Ackerley <hackerley@dmu.ac.uk>

<a name='assessment'></a>

## Assessment

You will be assessed continuously through the module with formal feedback given at two key points through the year as well as informally in labs. The full details of coursework 1 and 2 follows this brief overview. 

<div class="new">

### Coursework 1  

Worth **40%** of the module total, your first coursework will see you produce an individual piece of work. This will involve planning and designing a responsive website, this can include wireframe sketches, rough designs including navigation, mood board, content inventory, testing from card-sorting in the labs and interaction design (what changes, how and why). You also need to explain how you will prepare media types and text content for web delivery.

### Coursework 2  

Worth **60%** of the module total, this coursework will tackle HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ES6 to have you produce the website or web application you designed for coursework 1.

</div>

### Some notes on assessment submissions

All written submissions (i.e. reports and documentation) should be submitted through Turnitin. You will find a link to submit your report through the Assessment section on Blackboard.

You will be required to create a logical folder structure on your public server to which you will upload your practical work for marking. Follow the instructions for structure and naming exactly, and don’t put anything there that shouldn’t be marked. If your tutor is in any doubt as to where your work is, it may not get marked. 

Make sure the names of all files on your public server are *lower-case only*, with letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens - no spaces, no slashes!

If you are unsure about any details of an assessment, ask your lab tutor.

To reiterate:

All written work through Turnitin  
All practical work uploaded to your public server space

### Overview

~~Coursework 1 will see you tackle the specification and design of a media-driven web app. You will produce an interactive prototype which you will use for testing your design. You will also submit documentation that details what your web app is and does, your testing results, and justification for your design choices.~~

<p class="new">
  Coursework 1 will see you tackle the specification and design of a media-driven webpage. You will also submit documentation that details what your web app is and does, your testing results, and justification for your design choices.  
</p>

The submission deadline for this work is midday (12pm) on Friday 13th December. You are encouraged to seek feedback from your lab tutor throughout the first semester on your ongoing work.

This design and specification can form the basis of what you produce for Coursework 2, so this is a great opportunity to get some thorough feedback before moving onto production for the second coursework.


### Where to Start?

Your first job is to decide what your page is going to be. Although you are going to carry this design forward into coursework 2, you can make changes between the two based on the feedback you’ll get, so don’t feel you’ve got to commit to something that will satisfy CW2 right now. 

However, there are a number of points that your page must satisfy: 
 
* Uses or presents audio and/or video content
* Animates the user interface
* Is accessible
* Is mobile-first and adapts to desktop
* Contains four pages, or is equivalent
* Is valid HTML
  
If you’re stuck for an idea, you’ll find some suggestions at the end of this brief, so feel free to use one of them.  

<p class="new">
  add stuff about what to do after they found a suitable topic.
  e.g. start drawing out sketches, etc
</p>


### What to Submit / Deliverables

Your final submission will be a single compiled report of 1200 words plus imagery and references, preferably as a PDF.

The report should contain:

* a brief outline explaining what your website is about
* wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* design sketches and finished design
* evidence of user feedback
* commentary and/or annotations
* critical analysis

The report might also contain:

* site map
* content inventory
* user stories / user profiles
* moodboard, colour theme, font choices, etc.
* consistent formatted references

Your report will be submitted through Turnitin. If you do not submit through Turnitin, it will not be marked.



### Assignment 1 Marking Criteria

There are five marking criteria, each worth an equal 20% of the total coursework mark for assignment 1.

This means that each deliverable might contribute to several or all of the marking criteria and vice-versa. 

<!-- For example your wireframes might show:

- a clear difference in design for mobile and desktop sizes
- some critical thinking in your annotations and testing of different design options if you show some alternatives or earlier iterations
- how you plan to organise your content
- how you plan on addressing accessibility in your site
- perhaps how certain elements will change based on user input -->


#### Information Architecture

This is concerned with the organisation and structure of your content.

- every section/page is easily findable from any other section/page 
- content follows logical groups and avoids cognitive overload
- suitable headings and subheadings, and lists, etc. where appropriate
- clear thinking about users, content and context
- consistent language (controlled vocabulary) throughout the site
- justification of design, regarding familiar mental models and assumptions the target audience may already have
- clear indication of current location in respect of whole website content ("you are here", breadcrumbs, highlight current menu item, etc.)

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

* site map
* content inventory
* wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* design sketches and finished design
* user stories / user profiles


#### Responsiveness

This is concerned with the degree to which to make sure your site adapts to the screen size it is being used on.

- awareness of mobile first design principles
- clear differences between mobile and desktop versions (and tablet version if needed)
- navigation and menus respond to changes in  and are suitable for any screen width
- content layout adapts to any screen size
- mobile content takes account of readability (e.g. font size, heading length, button/link size)
- conceiling complexity and simplifying content for mobile screen sizes

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

* wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* design sketches and finished design


#### Design & Interaction

This is concerned with your plans for user interaction with elements on your page (e.g. clicks, hovers, and scrolls). This may include transitions, animations, and transforms.

- adherence to PARC principles
- creative use of white space (no overcrowding, especially at desktop size)
- consistent margins and alignment of design elements
- legible fonts and colour choices
- visual design scales smoothly to larger screen sizes 
- any interaction is appropriate to device type (e.g. no dependence on hover for mobile)
- consistent use of hover states
- creative use of interaction (e.g. dropdown menus, swiping, animations, scroll events, ...)

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

* moodboard, colour theme, font choices, etc.
* wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* design sketches and finished design


#### Accessibility

This is concerned with the degree to which you make sure your site is as accessible as possible to all.

- content inventory includes alt image attribute text
- planning for accessible media (e.g. video subtitles, full user controls)
- awareness of semantic structure
- main content is clearly distinct from rest of page
- clickable targets are large enough on mobile
- colour scheme has enough contrast
- text is readable and zoomable (especially on mobile) 

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

* site map
* content inventory
* wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* design sketches and finished design
* user stories / user profiles
* moodboard, colour theme, font choices, etc.

<!-- https://www.dmu.ac.uk/policies/accessibility/accessibility-guidelines.aspx -->
<!-- Consider using the [Web Accessiblity Evaluation Tool (WAVE)](https://wave.webaim.org/). -->


#### Critical Analysis

This is concerned with your ability to critically evaluate your own skills, needs, and planning process. 

- honest self-evaluation of your strengths and weaknesses so far
- clear grasp of skills you need to implement and build the actual website
- outline of any third-party involvement in your planning process (e.g. card sorting, feedback on wireframes and/or designs)
- clear and readable structure of overall document (headings, page numbers, image captions, etc.)
- back up any assertions (e.g. "most people use a smartphone these days") with specific references

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

* evidence of user feedback (e.g. card sorting, design feedback, ...)
* consistent reference formatting


### Example website ideas

Here are a few examples of what you could do. You can use one of these ideas as a start point as it is, or simply for inspiration to get you going. 

#### A Single-Page Website

Multiple sections combine into a single long vertical-scrolling page. As the user scrolls down, new sections are introduced through a combination of background (colour, shape, image) and foreground (text, graphics) animations. A menu provides direct access to each section.

#### Portfolio Website

A CV like website that lists achievements and showcases demos of your work.

#### Online Gallery

A grid of thumbnails presents a range of artwork. Click on one and you can see it full size, alongside notes such as the artist, medium, date etc. The thumbnails in the grid are resizeable - when they're made larger, you get less in a row - they rearrange. The grid is filterable: the user selects to just show photography, everything else disappears and the grid rearranges.

#### A Personalised Story

The user enters their name and other details on page 1, before being presented with a simple interactive story that incorporates these details. Animations mark the transition between scenes and the introduction of text and graphics within them.

### Overview

In semester 1 you designed and prototyped a modern web app or website. For this coursework you will go on to produce it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

You will first make any modifications to the design that you think are necessary following feedback from your tutor and peers. You will then let loose your webdev skills in realising your dream design. 

As well as your practical work, you will also submit a report documenting your updated design, production work, and evaluation of your finished project. 

But what if you don't want to use your design from Coursework 1? That's fine, your tutor can provide you with a prototype on which to base your work, just as if it was done for the previous coursework.

Some key points to consider:

* Make sure to pay attention to the marking criteria. A good mark for Coursework 1 doesn't automatically translate to a website that hits all the criteria for coursework 2 - you may need to adapt your design
* Don't skimp on the testing - this is critically important and **will** get you a better mark. 
* Stick to your (updated) design. If you need to differ from it, make sure to discuss this in your report.

Any content that is not yours (images, music, sound effects, etc.) should be appropriately referenced at a minimum in a list in the documentation (note that Google, or other search engines are not sources of information). Failure to do so is plagiarism and may effect your grade. This does not prevent you from getting your colleagues or tutor to criticise early drafts of your work before it is handed in / published.

Any content you produce for your website such as an audio interview will be marked primarily on its suitability for web deployment rather than its own production value. For example, a video that is stored at a much larger size than it is displayed at would be a no no. You have other modules where you are keenly assessed on the production value of your digital output. Speak to your tutor if you have any questions about this.

There are two main components to this coursework: the website itself and a portfolio of associated documentation. The website attracts 60% of the mark for this coursework, and the documentation 40%.

### Documentation

**Weighting:** 40% of the coursework mark, broken down as follows.  
**Word Count:** 1500 words, plus appropriate screenshots.

Your documentation should consist of the following components:

#### Overview of Designs

**Weighting:** 10% of the coursework mark 
 
You should include your designs, whether updated or not. These should be accompanied by a commentary that addresses:

* what was strong about your design
* what has changed and why
* where you think your main challenge(s) might be - and a fallback plan
* what you consider to be the priority feature(s) of your design

This should be written in light of your own evaluation of your design from CW1, your peer feedback, and your tutor feedback.

If you are using a tutor-supplied design then you will not have tutor feedback, but you should still gather peer feedback informally in order to assess the design you are using.

#### Production

**Weighting:** 10% of the coursework mark

This should give some insight into the development of your website. Pick three individual components and discuss:

* What you were trying to achieve
* How you did this
* Why you chose the approach you did
* How successful the approach was

Examples of what is meant here by an individual component of your website include a slideshow, a dropdown menu, an accordian display, an animated transition between pages and so on.

#### Evaluation

**Weighting:** 20% of the coursework mark  

You should address the following points:

* Provide evidence of testing (e.g. all links work, media loads, the site is consistent across browsers).  
* Provide evidence and a breakdown of structured user testing and feedback.  
* Evaluate your work, with reference to testing where appropriate, and user feedback, describing:  
	* Your achievements, refer back to the original aims, explain any changes to your original ideas and why or how they have happened.  
	* Any limitations of your web site  
	* Any improvements you would make to the site and why  
	* Any problems you encountered along the way, with potential solutions where possible

Your complete documentation should be submitted through the Turnitin link on Blackboard no later than midday on Friday 3rd April.

### Website

**Weighting:** 60% of the coursework mark, broken down as follows.  
**Volume:** 4 pages or equivalent.

Your site should be accessible via your `public_html` folder. It should be located at `public_html > TECH3015 > coursework2 > production`.

The website will be assessed on the following three points.

#### Content

**Weighting:** 15% of the coursework mark

Your website content should be fit for purpose and appropriate. This includes all text, graphics, images, sounds, and videos. You should use the correct techniques for displaying these in modern web browsers and ensure that you are using disk space and bandwidth efficiently. 

* Text content shows semantic structure e.g. headings, lists  
* Careful selection, creation and editing of video and/or audio  
* Awareness of loading speed and disk space e.g. no huge images  
* Original content is credited and third-party content is referenced  


#### Style

**Weighting:** 15% of the coursework mark

Your website should appeal to your intended audience and be consistent with your storyboards/designs. You should make appropriate use of CSS in order to properly style and layout your site.

* Style and layout reflect/have evolved from design
* Coherent overall design, colour and font choices 
* Design and content matches the target audience
* Skilful use of CSS to style and arrange site elements

#### Technical Skills 

**Weighting:** 30% of the coursework mark

Your web site should contain a variety of appropriate techniques that demonstrate your ability to apply the concepts you have learnt in this module.

* Evidence of intelligent ability to choose and code current website techniques 
* Awareness of usability/accessibility (semantic HTML5 tags and image “alt” attributes) 
* Use of CSS animations and transitions  
* All links work, media loads, site is consistent across browsers
* Excellent use of at least two of:
	* Local database storage
	* Third-party APIs
	* SVG animation
	* Responsive design
