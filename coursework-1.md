## Overview

<p class="new">
  Coursework 1 will see you tackle the specification and design of a multimedia webpage. You will also submit documentation that details what your webpage is and does, your design process, and justification for your design choices.  
</p>

The submission deadline for this work is midday (12pm) on Friday 13th December 2019. You are encouraged to seek feedback from your lab tutor throughout the first semester on your ongoing work.

This design and specification can form the basis of what you produce for coursework 2 (but does not have to be), so this is a great opportunity to get some thorough feedback before moving onto production for the second coursework.


## Where to Start?

Your first job is to decide what your page is going to be. Although you are going to carry this design forward into coursework 2, you can make changes between the two based on the feedback you’ll get, so don’t feel you’ve got to commit to something that will satisfy CW2 right now. 

However, there are a number of points that your page should satisfy: 
 
<div class="new">

* uses or presents multimedia content
* animates the user interface
* is accessible
* is mobile-first and adapts to desktop
* is valid HTML
* contains four pages/sections

</div>
  
If you’re stuck for an idea, you’ll find some suggestions at the end of this brief, so feel free to use one of them.  

<div class="new">

Once you know what your website is going to be all about you can start planning it all out.

1. draw out some rough pencil sketches on paper
1. collect media content (i.e. images, videos, audio, icons, fonts, etc.)
1. start writing out any text content you might need
1. think about your menu structure (and possibly do some card sorting with some friends)
1. experiment with different colour schemes and fonts
1. produce more details designs (use Photoshop or similar)
1. get some feedback from friends about alternative designs
1. make sure any media content is resized, compressed, etc. for the web
1. experiment with different layouts, especially for different screen sizes

Finally, make sure you read the marking criteria and fill in any gaps that you haven't addressed already.

</div>


## What to Submit / Deliverables

Your final submission will be **a single compiled report of ~1200 words** plus imagery and references, preferably as a PDF.

The report should contain:

* a brief outline explaining what your website is about
* wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* design sketches and finished design
* evidence of user feedback
* commentary and/or annotations on images
* critical analysis

It might also contain:

* site map
* content inventory
* user stories / user profiles
* moodboard, colour theme, font choices, etc.
* consistent formatted references

Your report will be submitted through Turnitin. If you do not submit through Turnitin, it will not be marked.


## Marking Criteria

There are five marking criteria, each worth an equal 20% of the total coursework mark for assignment 1.

This means that each deliverable might contribute to several or all of the marking criteria and vice-versa. 

<!-- For example your wireframes might show:

- a clear difference in design for mobile and desktop sizes
- some critical thinking in your annotations and testing of different design options if you show some alternatives or earlier iterations
- how you plan to organise your content
- how you plan on addressing accessibility in your site
- perhaps how certain elements will change based on user input -->


### Information Architecture

This is concerned with the organisation and structure of your content.

- every section/page is easily findable from any other section/page 
- content follows logical groups and avoids cognitive overload
- suitable headings and subheadings, and lists, etc. where appropriate
- clear thinking about users, content and context
- consistent language (controlled vocabulary) throughout the site
- justification of design, regarding familiar mental models and assumptions the target audience may already have
- clear indication of current location in respect of whole website content ("you are here", breadcrumbs, highlight current menu item, etc.)

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

* site map
* content inventory
* wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* design sketches and finished design
* user stories / user profiles


### Responsiveness

This is concerned with the degree to which to make sure your site adapts to the screen size it is being used on.

- awareness of mobile first design principles
- clear differences between mobile and desktop versions (and tablet version if needed)
- navigation and menus respond to changes in  and are suitable for any screen width
- content layout adapts to any screen size
- mobile content takes account of readability (e.g. font size, heading length, button/link size)
- conceiling complexity and simplifying content for mobile screen sizes

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

* wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* design sketches and finished design


### Design & Interaction

This is concerned with your plans for user interaction with elements on your page (e.g. clicks, hovers, and scrolls). This may include transitions, animations, and transforms.

- adherence to PARC principles
- creative use of white space (no overcrowding, especially at desktop size)
- consistent margins and alignment of design elements
- legible fonts and colour choices
- visual design scales smoothly to larger screen sizes 
- any interaction is appropriate to device type (e.g. no dependence on hover for mobile)
- consistent use of hover states
- creative use of interaction (e.g. dropdown menus, swiping, animations, scroll events, ...)

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

* moodboard, colour theme, font choices, etc.
* wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* design sketches and finished design


### Accessibility

This is concerned with the degree to which you make sure your site is as accessible as possible to all.

- content inventory includes alt image attribute text
- planning for accessible media (e.g. video subtitles, full user controls)
- awareness of semantic structure
- main content is clearly distinct from rest of page
- clickable targets are large enough on mobile
- colour scheme has enough contrast
- text is readable and zoomable (especially on mobile) 

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

* site map
* content inventory
* wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* design sketches and finished design
* user stories / user profiles
* moodboard, colour theme, font choices, etc.

<!-- Consider using the [Web Accessiblity Evaluation Tool (WAVE)](https://wave.webaim.org/). -->


### Critical Analysis

This is concerned with your ability to critically evaluate your own skills, needs, and planning process. 

- honest self-evaluation of your strengths and weaknesses so far
- clear grasp of skills you need to implement and build the actual website
- outline of any third-party involvement in your planning process (e.g. card sorting, feedback on wireframes and/or designs)
- clear and readable structure of overall document (headings, page numbers, image captions, etc.)
- back up any assertions (e.g. "most people use a smartphone these days") with specific references

To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:

* evidence of user feedback (e.g. card sorting, design feedback, ...)
* consistent reference formatting


## Example website ideas

Here are a few examples of what you could do. You can use one of these ideas as a start point as it is, or simply for inspiration to get you going. 

**A Single-Page Website**  
Multiple sections combine into a single long vertical-scrolling page. As the user scrolls down, new sections are introduced through a combination of background (colour, shape, image) and foreground (text, graphics) animations. A menu provides direct access to each section.

**Portfolio Website**  
A CV like website that lists achievements and showcases demos of your work.

**Online Gallery**  
A grid of thumbnails presents a range of artwork. Click on one and you can see it full size, alongside notes such as the artist, medium, date etc. The thumbnails in the grid are resizeable - when they're made larger, you get less in a row - they rearrange. The grid is filterable: the user selects to just show photography, everything else disappears and the grid rearranges.

**A Personalised Story**  
The user enters their name and other details on page 1, before being presented with a simple interactive story that incorporates these details. Animations mark the transition between scenes and the introduction of text and graphics within them.
