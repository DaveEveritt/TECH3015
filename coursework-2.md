### Overview

In semester 1 you designed and prototyped a modern web app or website. For this coursework you will go on to produce it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

You will first make any modifications to the design that you think are necessary following feedback from your tutor and peers. You will then let loose your webdev skills in realising your dream design. 

As well as your practical work, you will also submit a report documenting your updated design, production work, and evaluation of your finished project. 

But what if you don't want to use your design from Coursework 1? That's fine, your tutor can provide you with a prototype on which to base your work, just as if it was done for the previous coursework.

Some key points to consider:

* Make sure to pay attention to the marking criteria. A good mark for Coursework 1 doesn't automatically translate to a website that hits all the criteria for coursework 2 - you may need to adapt your design
* Don't skimp on the testing - this is critically important and **will** get you a better mark. 
* Stick to your (updated) design. If you need to differ from it, make sure to discuss this in your report.

Any content that is not yours (images, music, sound effects, etc.) should be appropriately referenced at a minimum in a list in the documentation (note that Google, or other search engines are not sources of information). Failure to do so is plagiarism and may effect your grade. This does not prevent you from getting your colleagues or tutor to criticise early drafts of your work before it is handed in / published.

Any content you produce for your website such as an audio interview will be marked primarily on its suitability for web deployment rather than its own production value. For example, a video that is stored at a much larger size than it is displayed at would be a no no. You have other modules where you are keenly assessed on the production value of your digital output. Speak to your tutor if you have any questions about this.

There are two main components to this coursework: the website itself and a portfolio of associated documentation. The website attracts 60% of the mark for this coursework, and the documentation 40%.

### Documentation

**Weighting:** 40% of the coursework mark, broken down as follows.  
**Word Count:** 1500 words, plus appropriate screenshots.

Your documentation should consist of the following components:

#### Overview of Designs

**Weighting:** 10% of the coursework mark 
 
You should include your designs, whether updated or not. These should be accompanied by a commentary that addresses:

* what was strong about your design
* what has changed and why
* where you think your main challenge(s) might be - and a fallback plan
* what you consider to be the priority feature(s) of your design

This should be written in light of your own evaluation of your design from CW1, your peer feedback, and your tutor feedback.

If you are using a tutor-supplied design then you will not have tutor feedback, but you should still gather peer feedback informally in order to assess the design you are using.

#### Production

**Weighting:** 10% of the coursework mark

This should give some insight into the development of your website. Pick three individual components and discuss:

* What you were trying to achieve
* How you did this
* Why you chose the approach you did
* How successful the approach was

Examples of what is meant here by an individual component of your website include a slideshow, a dropdown menu, an accordian display, an animated transition between pages and so on.

#### Evaluation

**Weighting:** 20% of the coursework mark  

You should address the following points:

* Provide evidence of testing (e.g. all links work, media loads, the site is consistent across browsers).  
* Provide evidence and a breakdown of structured user testing and feedback.  
* Evaluate your work, with reference to testing where appropriate, and user feedback, describing:  
	* Your achievements, refer back to the original aims, explain any changes to your original ideas and why or how they have happened.  
	* Any limitations of your web site  
	* Any improvements you would make to the site and why  
	* Any problems you encountered along the way, with potential solutions where possible

Your complete documentation should be submitted through the Turnitin link on Blackboard no later than midday on Friday 3rd April.

### Website

**Weighting:** 60% of the coursework mark, broken down as follows.  
**Volume:** 4 pages or equivalent.

Your site should be accessible via your `public_html` folder. It should be located at `public_html > TECH3015 > coursework2 > production`.

The website will be assessed on the following three points.

#### Content

**Weighting:** 15% of the coursework mark

Your website content should be fit for purpose and appropriate. This includes all text, graphics, images, sounds, and videos. You should use the correct techniques for displaying these in modern web browsers and ensure that you are using disk space and bandwidth efficiently. 

* Text content shows semantic structure e.g. headings, lists  
* Careful selection, creation and editing of video and/or audio  
* Awareness of loading speed and disk space e.g. no huge images  
* Original content is credited and third-party content is referenced  


#### Style

**Weighting:** 15% of the coursework mark

Your website should appeal to your intended audience and be consistent with your storyboards/designs. You should make appropriate use of CSS in order to properly style and layout your site.

* Style and layout reflect/have evolved from design
* Coherent overall design, colour and font choices 
* Design and content matches the target audience
* Skilful use of CSS to style and arrange site elements

#### Technical Skills 

**Weighting:** 30% of the coursework mark

Your web site should contain a variety of appropriate techniques that demonstrate your ability to apply the concepts you have learnt in this module.

* Evidence of intelligent ability to choose and code current website techniques 
* Awareness of usability/accessibility (semantic HTML5 tags and image “alt” attributes) 
* Use of CSS animations and transitions  
* All links work, media loads, site is consistent across browsers
* Excellent use of at least two of:
	* Local database storage
	* Third-party APIs
	* SVG animation
	* Responsive design
