## CONTENT STRATEGY **01**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

> “when you’re designing a website, you should think about your content first.”
> 
> “we often created sites without thinking about strategy at all … we would first design a site that looked nice and matched our branding. Next, we made a list of all the stuff we had that we wanted to put on the site (content), and then we tried to fit all of our stuff into the newly designed site.”

Clarissa Peterson 2014, [Learning Responsive Web Design: A Beginner’s Guide](http://www.learningrwd.com/)

## CONTENT STRATEGY **01**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

- **Project manager:** We need a landing page for client X
- **Designer:** I can’t start the design until I see some content
- **Writer:** I can’t start writing until I see a design.

## CONTENT STRATEGY **02**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Word count:

- some sites need long, detailed copy 
- others must be stripped to the bare minimum 
- or you can strike a balance between the two
- optimum line length for readablity SEE https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY **03**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Search Engine Optimisation

- at least one descriptive `h1` tag per page or section
- semantic HTML5 tags are essential
- structured content (subheadings, lists, tables…)

The [Google SEO Starter Guide](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184) is excellent!

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY **02**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Your audience are they:

- sophisticated? 
- Down to earth? 
- University-level? 
- Predominately female/male/trans etc.?

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY **0i**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Messaging priorities:

- What is the most important point to convey? 
- The least important? 
- What needs to be said first (the hook)?
- What needs to be said just leading up to the call to action?

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY **0i**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Call to action

- What will the precise wording be? 
- What emotional and intellectual factors will motivate the visitor to click through?
