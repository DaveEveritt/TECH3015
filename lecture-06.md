## CONTENT STRATEGY **01**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

> “when you’re designing a website, you should think about your content first.”
> 
> “we often created sites without thinking about strategy at all … we would first design a site that looked nice and matched our branding. Next, we made a list of all the stuff we had that we wanted to put on the site (content), and then we tried to fit all of our stuff into the newly designed site.”

## CONTENT STRATEGY **02**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

- **Project manager:** We need a landing page for client X
- **Designer:** I can’t start the design until I see some content!
- **Writer:** I can’t start writing until I see a desig…

## CONTENT STRATEGY **03**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Word count:

- some sites need long, detailed copy 
- others must be stripped to the bare minimum 
- or you can strike a balance between the two

Use **subheadings** and **brief paragraphs**!

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY **04**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Search Engine Optimisation

- at least one descriptive `h1` tag per page or section
- semantic HTML5 tags are essential
- structured content (subheadings, lists, tables…)

The [Google SEO Starter Guide](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184) is excellent!

## CONTENT STRATEGY **05**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Are your audience:

- Educated and/or sophisticated?
- Down to earth?
- University-level?
- Predominately female/male/gay/trans etc.?

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY **06**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Getting your message across:

- What is the **most important** thing to convey?
- The *least* important?
- What needs to be said *first* (the hook)?
- What leads visitors to click a *call to action*?

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY **07**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Call to action

- What do you **want people to do** when visiting your website?
- What will the precise **call to action wording** be?
- What emotional/mental factors will **motivate people** to click through?

> Make every decision align with your website strategy

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY **08**

Time to be realistic!

> Strategy is the art of sensible planning to marshal your resources toward their most efficient and effective use, over a significant period of time.
> 
> A good strategy is flexible, and shows proper humility in the face of challenges. It does not pretend that miracles are possible or even desirable.

## CONTENT STRATEGY **09**

> When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, Apple was selling sixteen to eighteen models of Macintosh computer. Jobs told an interviewer that even he couldn’t give clear advice to a friend on which Mac model she should buy for her home. He … cut the number of models to four: two desktop computers and two laptops. The product line still reflects this strategic focus on real user needs and a meaningful product differentiation.
