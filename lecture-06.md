## CONTENT STRATEGY **01**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

> “when you’re designing a website, you should think about your content first.”
> 
> “we often created sites without thinking about strategy at all … we would first design a site that looked nice and matched our branding. Next, we made a list of all the stuff we wanted to put on the site (content), and then tried to fit all of our stuff into the newly designed site.”

<small>Clarissa Peterson (2014), [Learning Responsive Web Design](http://www.learningrwd.com/)</small>

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY **02**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

The infinite "chicken and egg" loop:

- **Project manager:** We need a landing page for client X
- **Designer:** I can’t start the design until I see some content!
- **Programmer:** I can’t code the design without a style guide
- **Writer:** I can’t start writing until I know the strategy
- **Project manager:** (stressed) we need a landing page…

Content strategy is the chicken *and* the egg…

## CONTENT STRATEGY **03**

labels, headings and URLs…

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and **naming things**

<small>—Phil Karlton (Netscape engineer)</small>

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY **03**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Writing **text content**:

- use **subheadings** and **brief paragraphs**!
- some sites need long, detailed copy 
- others must be stripped to the bare minimum 
- or you can strike a balance between the two:
  - up-front **simplicity** > **details** on request

**drill down**: a user-interface *design pattern*—users see a summary but can view more detail—you write text for both

<small>(More on **readability** next week)</small>

## CONTENT STRATEGY **04**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Search Engine Optimisation (**SEO**)

> Never, ever pay for SEO when you can build it in

- **tiered headings**: one `h1` tag per page, `h2` for each section
- **semantic HTML5 tags** are essential
- **structured content** (subheadings, lists, tables…)

The [Google SEO Starter Guide](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184) is excellent!

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY **05**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Are your audience:

- **Educated** and/or sophisticated?
- Have **specific interests** or focus?
- Are just **casually browsing**?
- Are from a certain **demographic/gender/nationality**?

> Make every design and content decision align with your overall website strategy

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY **06**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Getting your message across:

- What is the **most important** thing to convey?
- The **least** important?
- What needs to be said **first** (the hook)?
- What leads visitors to click a **call to action**?


## CONTENT STRATEGY **07**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

**Call to action**—when visitors make a decision

- What do you **want people to do** when visiting your site?
- Is your call to action **clearly prominent** on your site?
- What is the precise **call to action wording**?
- What emotional/mental factors **motivate people** to act?

## CONTENT STRATEGY **08**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Time to be realistic!

> Strategy is the art of sensible planning to marshal your resources toward their most efficient and effective use, over a significant period of time.
> 
> A good strategy is flexible, and shows proper humility in the face of challenges. It does not pretend that miracles are possible or even desirable.

<small>— Web Style Guide, Patrick J. Lynch and Sarah Horton</small>

## CONTENT STRATEGY **09**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

> When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, there were **sixteen to eighteen models** of computer—he said even he couldn’t give clear advice to a friend on which Mac model she should buy. He **cut the number of models to four**: two desktop and two laptop computers. The Apple product line still reflects this **strategic focus on real user needs** and a meaningful product differentiation.

<small>—abbreviated from: Web Style Guide, Patrick J. Lynch and Sarah Horton</small>

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY **10**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

> There’s no such thing as “mobile content.” What all readers and users need is **good content**, available **wherever and whenever** they need it, **on any device**. If some of your content looks superfluous on a mobile device, it’s certainly superfluous for desktop users as well. **Get rid of the useless fluff!**


> **Do not overwrite**. Small is good. A concise, high-quality site is much better than a big contraption full of broken links. Produce the **minimum necessary** to achieve an **excellent result**.

<small>—abbreviated from: Web Style Guide, Patrick J. Lynch and Sarah Horton</small>

Optimal button size:

![Optimal button size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaveEveritt/TECH3015/master/imgs/ui/optimal-button-size.png)

> users had the **lowest touch accuracy** on buttons **less than 42 pixels**. Buttons **over 72 pixels** also had low accuracy.


> The **highest accuracy** was found with buttons **between 42-72 pixels** — 42 pixels is the minimum and 72 pixels is the maximum button size.


> The **most preferred button size was 60 pixels**, which is about the middle of the range. The 72 pixel button produced the **highest touch accuracy** and was **preferred by older users**.
