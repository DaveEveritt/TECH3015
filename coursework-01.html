The Associate Professor Student Experience (<a href='mailto:CEMstudentexperience@dmu.ac.uk'>CEMstudentexperience@dmu.ac.uk</a>) should be informed of any issues relating to the return of marked coursework and feedback.</p>
<p>Note that you should normally receive feedback on your coursework by no later than 20 University working days after the formal hand-in date, provided that you have met the submission deadline.</p>
<p><strong>When completed you are required to submit your coursework to:</strong><br>
A PDF of your report should be submitted through the Turnitin link in the Assessments section of the TECH3015 Blackboard page (<a href="#deliverables">see deliverables below</a>).<br><br>If you need any support or advice on completing this coursework please visit the Student Matters tab on the Faculty of Technology Blackboard page.</p>
<p><strong>Late submission of coursework policy</strong><br>
Late submissions will be processed in accordance with current University regulations which state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the time period during which a student may submit a piece of work late without authorisation and have the work capped at 40% [50% at PG level] if passed is 14 calendar days. Work submitted unauthorised more than 14 calendar days after the original submission date will receive a mark of 0%.  These regulations apply to a student’s first attempt at coursework. Work submitted late without authorisation which constitutes reassessment of a previously failed piece of coursework will always receive a mark of 0%.”</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Worth <strong>40%</strong> of the module total, your first coursework will see you produce an individual piece of work. This will involve planning and designing a responsive website, this should include wireframe sketches, final designs including navigation, mood board, content inventory, testing from card-sorting in the labs and interaction design (what changes, how and why). You also need to explain how you will prepare media types and text content for web delivery.</p>
<p>The submission deadline for this work is <strong>midday (12pm) on Friday 13th December 2019</strong>. You are encouraged to seek feedback from your lab tutor throughout the first semester on your ongoing work.</p>
<p>This design and specification can form the basis of what you produce for coursework 2 (but does not have to be), so this is a great opportunity to get some thorough feedback before moving onto production for the second coursework.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to Start?</h2>
<p>Your first job is to decide what your page is going to be. Although you are going to carry this design forward into coursework 2, you can make changes between the two based on the feedback you’ll get, so don’t feel you’ve got to commit to something that will satisfy CW2 right now.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of points that your page should satisfy:</p>
<ul>
<li>uses or presents multimedia content</li>
<li>uses animation in the user interface</li>
<li>is accessible</li>
<li>is mobile-first, then adapts to any screen size</li>
<li>is valid HTML</li>
<li>contains multiple pages/sections</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re stuck for an idea, you’ll find some suggestions at the end of this brief, so feel free to use one of them.</p>
<p>Once you know what your website is going to be all about you can start planning it all out:</p>
<ul>
<li>draw out some rough pencil sketches and wireframes (you can start on paper)</li>
<li>collect media content (i.e. images, videos, audio, icons, fonts, etc.)</li>
<li>start writing out any text content you need (in plain text)</li>
<li>think about your menu structure (and possibly do some card sorting with some friends)</li>
<li>experiment with different colour schemes and fonts</li>
<li>produce more detailed designs (use Photoshop or similar or an online service)</li>
<li>get feedback from friends and others and keep a record of their comments</li>
<li>make sure your media content is resized, compressed, etc. for the web</li>
<li>experiment with different layouts, especially for different screen sizes</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, make sure you read the marking criteria and fill in any gaps that you haven't addressed already.</p>
<p><a name='deliverables'></a></p>
<h2 id="what-to-submit--deliverables">What to Submit / Deliverables</h2>
<p>Your final submission will be <strong>a single compiled report of around 1200 words</strong> plus imagery and references, as a PDF (you can generate a PDF from e.g. Word).</p>
<p>The report should contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>a brief outline explaining what your website is about</li>
<li>wireframes (mobile, tablet, desktop)</li>
<li>design sketches and finished design</li>
<li>evidence of user feedback</li>
<li>commentary and/or annotations on images</li>
<li>critical analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>It might also contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>site map</li>
<li>content inventory</li>
<li>user stories / user profiles</li>
<li>moodboard, colour theme, font choices, etc.</li>
<li>consistent formatted references</li>
</ul>
<p>Your report will be submitted through Turnitin. If you do not submit through Turnitin, it will not be marked.</p>
<h2 id="marking-criteria">Marking Criteria</h2>
<p>There are five marking criteria, each worth an equal 20% of the total coursework mark for assignment 1.</p>
<p>This means that each deliverable might contribute to several or all of the marking criteria and vice-versa.</p>
<!-- For example your wireframes might show:

- a clear difference in design for mobile and desktop sizes
- some critical thinking in your annotations and testing of different design options if you show some alternatives or earlier iterations
- how you plan to organise your content
- how you plan on addressing accessibility in your site
- perhaps how certain elements will change based on user input -->
<h3 id="information-architecture">Information Architecture</h3>
<p>This is concerned with the organisation and structure of your content.</p>

<li>clear indication of current location in respect of whole website content (&quot;you are here&quot;, breadcrumbs, highlight current menu item, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you meet the criteria above, consider preparing any or all of the following:</p>

<li>evidence of user feedback (e.g. card sorting, design feedback, ...)</li>
<li>consistent reference formatting</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-website-ideas">Example website ideas</h2>
<p>Here are a few examples of what you could do. You can use one of these ideas as a start point as it is, or simply for inspiration to get you going.</p>
<p><strong>A Single-Page Website</strong><br>
Multiple sections combine into a single long vertical-scrolling page. As the user scrolls down, new sections are introduced through a combination of background (colour, shape, image) and foreground (text, graphics) animations. A menu provides direct access to each section.</p>
<p><strong>Portfolio Website</strong><br>
A CV like website that lists achievements and showcases demos of your work.</p>
<p><strong>Online Gallery</strong><br>
A grid of thumbnails presents a range of artwork. Click on one and you can see it full size, alongside notes such as the artist, medium, date etc. The thumbnails in the grid are resizeable - when they're made larger, you get less in a row - they rearrange. The grid is filterable: the user selects to just show photography, everything else disappears and the grid rearranges.</p>
<p><strong>A Personalised Story</strong><br>
The user enters their name and other details on page 1, before being presented with a simple interactive story that incorporates these details. Animations mark the transition between scenes and the introduction of text and graphics within them.</p>
