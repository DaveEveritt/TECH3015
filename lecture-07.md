![toggles with and without icons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TECH3015/lectures/master/imgs/ui/check-status.png)

Accessibility and colour contrast e.g. **icons** help color-blind users distinguish **selected status**

## EXTRA RESOURCES **03**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

> The measure of good editorial style is whether the content is useful… Content should meet real, carefully researched **user needs**. Too often corporate and institutional web teams produce content designed primarily around **internal** goals and **organization** charts, forgetting that **users couldn’t care less** what your mission statement is, or how you are organized.

## INFORMATION DESIGN **01**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

We **forage** for information like we do for **resources**

## INFORMATION DESIGN **02**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Information Architecture **makes foraging easier**  
**Information Design** conveys *meaning*

> Information design is the skill and practice of **preparing information** so people can use it with **efficiency** and **effectiveness**. Where data is **complex** or **unstructured**, **visual representation** expresses meaning more clearly

---

## INFORMATION DESIGN **03**

Information **Architecture** is *getting around*  
Information **Design** is good *visual presentation*

## INFORMATION DESIGN **04**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

**Small changes**: give users a brief cue about what's in the text, **before they commit to reading** it, then use a **longer headline**

## INFORMATION DESIGN **05**

## DARK UI **01**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

> For many years, telling someone you worked on **user interface design** or **human-computer interaction** would produce puzzled looks and require explanation. With the rise of design and interaction for interactive devices, these terms became **much more familiar** to people outside the discipline…

---

## DARK UI **02**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

> …but lately, it is likely to evoke a **skeptical** or **mistrustful** response. The series of scandals—over **userdata management**, **online profiling**, **user tracking**, **targeted manipulation**, **digital addiction**… means user experience professionals face **new questions**.

## DARK UI **03**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

> **Dark Patterns** are UI tricks that make you do things you didn't mean to, like **opting in** or **signing up**.
>
> …because you **skim read** and **make assumptions**… companies take advantage by **tricking you** into doing things, e.g. by making page elements **appear** to say one thing when they **really** mean another.  
>
> **Defend yourself** by learning about Dark Patterns.
