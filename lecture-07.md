## DARK UI **01**

> For many years, telling someone in everyday settings that you worked on user interface design or human-computer interaction would produce puzzled looks and require more explanation. With the rise of design and interaction associated with the proliferation of interactive devices, these terms became much more familiar to people outside the discipline. 



## DARK UI **02**

> Lately, though, there has been a second shift. Lately, if you tell someone that you work on interactive systems, or make interaction effective and enjoyable, it is likely to evoke a skeptical or mistrustful response. In light of a series of scandals—over user data management, online profiling, user tracking, targeted manipulation, digital addiction… user experience professionals and researchers have found themselves facing new questions about our work and its consequences. —Dourish, Paul (2019) [user-experience-as-legitimacy-trap](http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/november-december-2019/user-experience-as-legitimacy-trap)
